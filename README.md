# cvR
Used functions from the 'heloing.funders' shiny app (https://aushsi.shinyapps.io/orcid) to create CV using publications data from orcid.

The main function takes an ORCID ID and creates the publiction data. The key R package is `rorcid` and `rcrossref`.

The next version of the ORCID api will have additional details like memberships, invited positions, distinctions and awards meaning that it may be possible to create a full CV just by pulling data from ORCID.
